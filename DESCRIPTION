Description: routr is a simple ROOK compliant router for HTTP and WebSocket
    requests. A router takes care of accepting a URL request and delegating it
    to the correct handler function, thus simplifying the construction of web
    application back-ends. As the httpuv package is ROOK compliant too, routr
    works well with servers based on that package.
